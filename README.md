# Using-the-BERG-SAP-2012-model
Hi there

This is a repository for the files I have used to carry out sensitivity analysis using the BERG SAP 2012 Python model, developed by Steven Firth and Ben Halls.

It is a bit of an experiement for me to use an open model here and share input files so please get in touch if I have missed anything, something is unclear or just to discuss!

Hope this is helpful for future users of the model, or anybody who wishes to reproduce findings from my own research.

Best wishes,
Kate
